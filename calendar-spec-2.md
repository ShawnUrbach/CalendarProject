# Front End Code Challenge (phase 2)

### The Goal:
Working off your previous calendar foundation, convert your calendar app to CoffeeScript and add some functionality.

To get your app into CoffeeScript, you may either use a compiler manually and require in the resulting JS file into your html or spin up a tiny Node.JS app that will handle it automatically. The Node.JS app is obvioiusly a bit more than would be needed if this was a true solution but you might find it more pleasant to work with/debug due to the auto compiling. 

### The Requirements:
- Busines logic is written in CoffeeScript
- Be able to select a calendar day and have it reflect as selected in the calendar view as well as dispaly the selected date outside the calendar in the format: <month name> <date>, <year>
- Be able to type in a date and have the calendar go to that selection. Ex. a control that takes in a numeric value for the month, date, year and a "go" button that triggers the calendar paging to the provided date.
